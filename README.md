# NN_numbers
This project features a TensorFlow neural network trained on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit classification. It includes an HTTP server that handles POST requests with pixel data, processes it, predicts the digit, and returns the result and accuracy. The model has two hidden layers and uses the Adam optimizer.
